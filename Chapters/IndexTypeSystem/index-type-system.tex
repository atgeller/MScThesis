\section{The \name Indexed Type System}
\label{sec:typesys}
The \name type system was designed to provide sufficient information to safely eliminate dynamic checks (\ie to ensure that the required preconditions are met to \prechk-tag an instruction).
It is based on the type system from \dtal, which is capable of proving similar properties.
An indexed type language uses an index language in the type system to encode information within types.
As in \dtal, we use the index language to encode linear constraints on program variables within types, giving us sufficient information to prove the desired properties of instructions.

\subsection{The \name Index Type Language}

    \begin{math}
        \begin{array}{rcl}
            t &:: & \<ithreetwo> \mid \<isixfour> \\
            a &::= & Var \\
            x\;y &::=& a \mid (t\;c) \mid (binop\;x\;y) \\
            P &::=& (testop\;x) \mid (relop\;x\;y) \mid \neg P \mid P \land P \mid P \lor P \\
            \phi &::=& \circ \mid \phi, (t\;a) \mid \phi, P \\
        \end{array}
    \end{math}
    \caption{Syntax of the \name index type language}
    \label{fig:itsyntax}
\end{figure}

Figure~\ref{fig:itsyntax} shows the syntax for the index type language.
Syntax written in a \tbbf{blue, bold font} denotes a \wasm keyword.
Below is a quick overview of each of the terms.

\begin{itemize}
    \item $t$ represents a primitive \wasm type.
    We do not reason about floating points, so it is either a 32-bit integer ($i32$) or a 64-bit integer ($i64$).
    \item $a$ is a type index variable which is associated with a program variable.
    \item $x$ and $y$ are type indices, they can be an index type variable, a constant with an explicit type, or an operation on a type index.
    \item $P$ is a proposition (constraint) on type indices.
    \item $\phi$ is the index type context which stores index type variable declarations and propositions (constraints).
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Extending The \wasm Type System}
\thought{The overall hope is that the exposition suffices to make most of the typing rules appear straightforward once one understands all of the magic symbols. The section aims to provide a little more insight into how exactly the type system was magically conceived.}

In \name, we extend \wasm's technique for handling the stack to include an index context $\phi$ (which contains type index variable declarations and the constraints on indices) and the index types of local and global variables (similar to the Register file in \dtal) in the precondition and postcondition.
Now, a precondition on the stack would look like $(t\ a); \phi; l; l$, where $(t\ a)$ is an index type, and $l$ and $g$ map local and global variables, respectively, to index type variables.
