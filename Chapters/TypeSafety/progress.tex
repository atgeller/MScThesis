\section{Progress}
\emph{Progress} ensures that if a program is well-typed then it either: entirely consists of values, traps, or is reducible (\ie there exists another program that it reduces to).
Since most \name instructions have the same semantics as in \wasm, and every \name type includes all the information of a \wasm type, we can reuse the \wasm proof for those instructions (see \ref{subsec:erasure}).
The intuition for this is that the \name indexed type system provides strictly more information than the \wasm type system.
However, for \name instructions that do not have the same semantics as in \wasm, specifically \prechk-tagged instructions, we still must prove those cases.
