    Downloading and executing untrusted code is inherently unsafe, but also something that happens often on the internet.
    Therefore, untrusted code often requires run-time checks to ensure safety during execution.
    These checks compromise performance and may be unnecessary.
    We present the \name language, an assembly language based on WebAssembly that is intended to ensure safety while justifying the static elimination of run-time checks.
