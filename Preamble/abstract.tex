\chapter{Abstract}
Downloading and executing untrusted code requires careful considerations to ensure that it is safe, but also something that happens often on the internet.
Therefore, untrusted code often requires run-time checks to ensure safety during execution.
These checks compromise performance and may be unnecessary.
We present the \name language, an assembly language based on WebAssembly that is intended to ensure the same level of safety as WebAssembly while justifying the static elimination of run-time checks.
