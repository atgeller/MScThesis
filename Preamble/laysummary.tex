\chapter{Lay Summary}
Downloading and running programs from unknown sources is very unsafe, but also very common.
These untrusted programs usually require extra work to run safely.
JavaScript, the programming language that is most common for websites, is notoriously unsafe and slow, so we want to have an alternate language that is faster and safer.

We have designed a programming language, \name, that is meant to be safe without requiring extra work, potentially making it faster as well as safe.
\name is built on top of WebAssembly, the only other programming language designed to run in browsers, that is supported by all of the major browsers (Firefox, Chrome, Edge, and Safari).
We contribute the design of \name, as well as a reference implementation, and prove that \name is in fact safe.
