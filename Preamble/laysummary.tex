\chapter{Lay Summary}
Downloading and running code from unknown sources is unsafe, but also quite common.
Ill-behaved or erroneous code can expose your data or crash your
browser.
Unfortunately, mitigating these risks often slows down programs.
WebAssembly is a language supported by many browsers and designed to be
both fast and safe, but the language still requires potentially unnecessary
safety check which make websites slower and less efficient.

We have designed a programming language based on WebAssembly, called
\name, that is meant to be as safe as WebAssembly without requiring
as many safety check.
\name uses a more expressive type system then WebAssembly to help the
computer reason about when this extra work may be unnecessary.
We contribute the design of \name, as well as a reference
implementation, and prove that \name is in fact as safe as WebAssembly.
